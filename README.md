# 📱 Saraiki Vocabulary Learning Mobile Application

A mobile application designed to help users learn basic Saraiki vocabulary through interactive flashcards, audio pronunciation, and gamified quizzes. Developed using Flutter and Firebase as part of a Final Year Project.

---

## 📖 Introduction

Saraiki is a rich and expressive regional language spoken by millions in southern Punjab, Pakistan. Despite its cultural significance, digital tools for learning Saraiki are scarce. This project aims to develop a mobile application that helps users learn commonly used words in Saraiki through interactive and engaging methods.

## ❗ Problem Statement

There is a lack of accessible mobile applications for learning basic Saraiki vocabulary. Language learners, especially younger generations, have limited exposure to structured digital resources that support vocabulary acquisition in Saraiki. This gap contributes to the gradual decline in fluency and cultural connection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design and develop a mobile app focused on teaching Saraiki numbers and common words (greetings, family & relationships, food, etc).
- Provide visual aids and interactive quizzes for effective learning.
- Promote the preservation and accessibility of the Saraiki language through technology.

## 📚 Literature Review

Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) has shown consistent benefits for vocabulary acquisition, learner motivation, and autonomy.

- **Li (2022)** reviewed 30 studies and found that mobile apps significantly improve vocabulary retention and learner confidence, especially when they include gamified and interactive features.
- **Zhou and Zhou (2024)** conducted a meta-analysis of 65 studies and confirmed that personalized mobile environments outperform traditional methods in vocabulary learning.
- **Dağdeler (2023)** analyzed 687 publications and emphasized the importance of multimedia, offline access, and culturally relevant content—key considerations for underrepresented languages.

These findings support the design choices of this project, including bite-sized lessons, gamification, offline mode, and culturally contextualized vocabulary.
